## About this project

This is a parser for the ActiveOberon language as specified [in the 2004 language report](https://web.archive.org/web/20110524062849/http://bluebottle.ethz.ch/languagereport/ActiveReport.pdf).

The grammar in Ao.ebnf is compatible with [EbnfStudio](https://github.com/rochus-keller/EbnfStudio) which was also used to generate the included AoParser/AoSynTree/AoTokenType.h/.cpp. 

The current version of the parser is able to parse all 635 module files in https://github.com/OberonSystem3/AOS_Bluebottle_Sources in 8 seconds on a EliteBook 2530p with no error.
